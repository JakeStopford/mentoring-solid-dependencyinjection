Dependency injection is a set of software design principles and patterns that enable us to develop loosely coupled code.


Dependency Injection Benefits:

1. Maintainability - Loosely coupled classes are easier to maintain and fix.

2. Testability - Easier to test loosely coupled classes that only do one thing. Creating mocks is easier too. 

3. Readability - Constructors aren’t as cluttered and filled with logic. Classes are more clearly defined, openly declaring what they need.

4. Flexibilty - Small classes that do one thing can more easily be reassembled and reused in different situations.

5. Extensibility - Code that uses dependency injection results in a more extendable class structure. By relying on abstractions instead of implementations, code can easily vary a given implementation.
